    <p class="c-four">
        I am writing to express my keen interest in the internship opportunity at 
        mHub. As a highly motivated and results-oriented student pursuing a 
        Business Information Technology degree at the Malawi University of Science 
        and Technology, I possess a strong foundation in Computer Networks as well 
        as Web Development, both front and backend.
    </p>

    <p class="c-four">
        I am particularly drawn to mHub due to your company's reputation for 
        cutting-edge innovation and expertise offered as well as the various training 
        programs.
    </p>

    <p class="c-four">
        I look forward to working during my holiday ending February 11th, 2024.
    </p>

    <p class="c-two">
        Yours Faithfully, <br />
